 Open /src/App.js
 Remove the newTodo state variable and the corresponding JSX that displays it

 Declare a new function named addTodo that takes newTodo as a parameter
 
    Call the setTodoList state setter and use the spread operator to pass the existing Objects in the todoList Array along with the newTodo Object

    Change the value of the onAddTodo prop for AddTodoForm to addTodo

 Open /src/AddTodoForm.js

 Inside handleAddTodo, update the onAddTodo callback prop to pass an Object instead of a String; Object should have the following properties:
    title: equal to todoTitle
    id: unique identifier (hint: use Date.now() to generate a unique number)

Disclaimer: we are suggesting Date.now() for now as a placeholder for unique number generation, but in the future you should not use this

Inside handleAddTodo, remove the reset() method and replace it with logic to reset the todoTitle state to an empty String

Run your application and view in browser:
 Enter a todo in "Add Todo" form, submit, and verify item is visible in todo list
 Enter another todo, submit, and verify that two items are visible in todo list
