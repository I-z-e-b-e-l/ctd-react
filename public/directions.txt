 Open /src/App.js
☑ Remove the newTodo state variable and the corresponding JSX that displays it

 ☑ Declare a new function named addTodo that takes newTodo as a parameter
 
    ☑ Call the setTodoList state setter 

    Use the spread operator (...) to pass the existing Objects in the todoList Array along with the newTodo Object
    ❓What array? todoListstate? 

    Change the value of the onAddTodo prop for AddTodoForm to addTodo

 Open /src/AddTodoForm.js

 Inside handleAddTodo:
 Update the onAddTodo callback prop to pass an Object instead of a String; Object should have the following properties:
    ☑title: equal to todoTitle
    ☑id: unique identifier (hint: use Date.now() to generate a unique number)

Disclaimer: we are suggesting Date.now() for now as a placeholder for unique number generation, but in the future you should not use this

☑ Inside handleAddTodo, remove the reset() method and replace it with logic to reset the todoTitle state to an empty String

Run your application and view in browser:
 Enter a todo in "Add Todo" form, submit, and verify item is visible in todo list
 Enter another todo, submit, and verify that two items are visible in todo list
